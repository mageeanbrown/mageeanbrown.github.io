This project evolved from an independent study project that I started during one semester of undergrad. At the time that I began the project, I had barely used CAD, had very little machining experience, and was just beginning to seriously practice TIG welding. Unsuprisingly, building a bicycle frame from scratch required that I get good at all of these skills. 

By the end of that first semester, I got very comfortable with CAD and taught myself how to run FEA in Solidworks. I also improved my machine shop skills, and racked up many hours on the manual mills and lathes, as well as on the CNC mill. But alas, my welding skills were not honed enough to weld the thin bicycle tubing (some tubes are as thin as 0.028 inches!), so I did not complete the project that semester. 

A year later, and after welding a racecar (see more about this [here](/projects/2_project/)), I returned to the project with much more fabrication experience. I designed machined a high-precision and adjustable jig, which is essential for holding all the components tightly together during the welding process. Then, after getting the tubes cut according to my CAD design, I was able to fully weld the frame. I also brazed for the first time to attach some of the smaller components, like the water bottle bosses.

Unfortunately, I had to leave this project at home when I moved across the country for grad school. The rest of the components still need to be assembled, but I am very proud of how the frame turned out!

    The jig in action. Creating the jig took much longer than the actual welding process, but is essential for achieving precise frame geometry and making strong welds. The components I machined to hold the tubes are made from aluminum and are mounted on a T-slot aluminum extrusion, allowing the entire system to be adjustable for future frames.

Below, you'll see some of my more recent welds (getting better, but still more practice to be done!) and the frame post-welding/brazing. The final steps will involve painting the frame, facing and reaming the frame (to remove distortion from welding in important areas, such as the bottom bracket shell, head tube, and seat tube), and buying/installing the remaining parts to make the bike ready for riding.
