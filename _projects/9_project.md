This is a collection of various small projects that I've done throughout the years (at least the ones I took pictures of).

    Some technical resin 3D prints I made for a research project that I was helping a grad student with while at Brown. The project was to recreate a scaled-up model of shrimp appendages with varying degrees of detail. For the most detailed structure, there were hair-like structures that were virtually impossible to print with conventional 3D printing techniques. To make the print successful using a $250 printer, I had to slice the model into 7 pieces, which allowed me to orient each piece separately, then 'glue' (with resin) and sand the model as the final step.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
