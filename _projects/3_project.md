For this project, I studied the biomechanics of oysters as part of the Marine Biomechanics course at Friday Harbor Laboratories in Washington. Specifically, I explored how shelf-like extrusions on the shell, called flutes, influence the hydrodynamics of the environment surrounding oysters, in addition to how fluting affects temperature regulation. 

Flutes are illustrated in the figure below. Interestingly, oysters of the same species (here, the Pacific Oyster) may or may not exhibit fluting.

    </div>

<div class="caption">
Flutes, or shelves that are concentric with growth lines on the shell, are outlined in grey. Flute amplitude is defined in (a) as the height of each flute, or shelf. In (b), a side view of overhanging flutes is shown. Overhanging flutes are those in which a flute underside is visible. Another perspective (facing the fringe of the oyster) of overhanging flutes is shown in (c).

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
