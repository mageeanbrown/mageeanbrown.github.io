Hello! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at Caltech (GALCIT). I am passionate about environmental fluid dynamics and, as an experimental researcher with a love for side-projects, I have entensive fabrication experience. I received my M.S. in Aeronautics from Caltech and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Brown University. 

In the Dabiri Lab at Caltech, I study vortex interactions between biohybrid jellyfish. Eventually, this will help enable low-cost and scalable ocean exploration and monitoring technology. To learn more about this work, or the other things I've been up to, check out my [projects](/projects/) and [CV](/cv/).
