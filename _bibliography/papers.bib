title = {Can hair help you swim faster? Yes, if you ask shrimp!},
abstract={Bio-inspired underwater robots have the potential to start a new era of marine exploration by achieving high maneuverability and efficiency through simplified biological characteristics, including kinematics and morphology. Hair-bearing appendages are present in many metachronal, drag-based swimmers propelling at intermediate Reynolds number (Re) and act as either paddles or rakes, depending on the induced flow regime and morphology. However, studies on leakiness have focused on low Re flows and simplified geometries, and their results are thus not applicable to understanding the hydrodynamics of most metachronal swimmers. Here, we use a scaled-up swimming appendage with varied morphologies to characterize leakiness within a relevant range of Re numbers. Key kinematic and morphological characteristics of Palaemon paludosus, a representative marine metachronal organism, are integrated. We perform two-dimensional velocimetry experiments and acquire force transducer measurements to investigate the role of setae in thrust generation, tip vortex shedding, and performance. Our results illustrate the role of setae at the intermediate Re regime for the first time. This study will inform the engineering of underwater solutions, from bio-inspired robotics to particle filtering.},

  abstract = {Shrimp can adapt to their environment through dynamic morphology, contributing to their remarkable maneuverability and efficiency during swimming. Integral to this morphological adaptability of shrimp is the cupping of leg appendages (pleopods) during their power and recovery stroke. Cupping occurs through the change in the cupping angle between each endopodite and exopodite pair that make up a pleopod. This cupping angle contributes to the actuation of the exopodite to spread outward (abduction) during the power stroke and to move inward (adduction) during the recovery stroke. Previous studies have given insight into these pleopod kinematics. However, the optimal angle of pleopod cupping for different swimming modes and hydrodynamic conditions still needs to be explored. Here, we use biological studies of shrimp to guide the design of a robotic pleopod, which we leveraged to investigate the hydrodynamics of pleopod cupping. Through Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments and force measurements, we examine the thrust, lift, and vortex generation across a range of cupping angle configurations. We compare the cupping angle of optimal efficiency to the cupping angle found in shrimp (approximately 35\textdeg) to understand the trade-off between lift and thrust generation. Implementing the optimal cupping angle will ensure the maneuverability of future underwater metachronal robots under different environmental conditions.},

	title = {Exploring the trade-off of lift and thrust during shrimp swimming},
	html = {https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD24/Session/X04.3},
	abstract = {Shrimp use the dynamic morphology of their pleopods to maximize net thrust and produce the necessary lift to maintain their depth in the water column while cruising. Shrimp can achieve this by cupping the distal pleopod segment, composed of the endopodite and exopodite, which induces a change in the angle of incidence ({AoI}) of the exopodite. The exopodite {AoI} enables the distribution of forces into global lift and thrust. Using a biologically inspired robotic analog based on the Pleobot, we vary the cupping angle from 0° to 80° and the biologically relevant 35°. Through Particle Image Velocimetry, direct force measurements, and a reduced-order model, we investigate the mechanisms leading to the trade-off between lift and thrust-producing forces at different cupping angles. We found that changing the cupping angle modulates lift and thrust production, and drag-based thrust forces are primarily responsible for propulsion. Further, we show that propulsive forces produced by beating pleopods can be estimated using the linear superposition of drag and inertial forces based on measured morphological parameters. Our results elucidate the mechanism by which shrimp trade-off lift and thrust, which can be leveraged in developing and designing metachronal underwater vehicles.},
